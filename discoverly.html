                        The Discoverly app was created as a means for people to easily connect with accurate, reliable information. The primary concern for the design of this app was making an easy and intuitive scheduling system and video chat for an all-in-one experience for the user.

                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>"Why is finding reliable information so challenging?" "Most of what I find online...I take with a grain of salt."
                            The goal was to bridge the gap between young professionals and industry experienced experts. There's often a disconnect between what is posted online and accurate information, as well as the physical barrier that is created when humans interact online.
                            Discoverly provides a means of connection between humans and accurate information.

                        <p>I conducted user interviews to build new personas and to inform the design. I created 13 open-ended questions, focusing on our users educational values, information collection habits, and their internet usage.
                            In 2 days I recruited and interviewed 3 users remotely.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                            <p>
                                Most used the internet for quick inquiries include unprecedented questions that came up periodically throughout the day, such as trivial information or assistance with work/school related questions.
Users typically regarded the legitimacy of information found online with a laisezz fair attitude: "feeling it out" or as one user put it, "Does anyone [check for accuracy]?"
                            </p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Observe</h2>
                                <p>On the outset of the project I created a series of survey questions regarding users internet-based information gathering habits.
                                    It included 6 multiple choice questions. 17 individuals responded to the survey.
                                    The quantitative data varied greatly amongst what users were actually using the internet to search for. This was surprising as I had previously hypothesized that while many subjects would be represented, there would be clear conclusions.
                                </p>
                                <div>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>50% of Respondents preferred Text communication over email and in- person. </li>
                                            <li>Over 50% searched the internet 1-4x per day.</li>
                                            <li>82% used the internet to search from home. 56% used the internet between 12-6pm. </li>
                                            <li>Purpose for internet searching varied greatly, but the greatest proportion 32% said that they most often used it for medical questions.</li>
                                            <li>Top complaints about communicating virtually included Lack of in-person connection, as well as planning & scheduling a time.</li>

                        <h3>Understanding the User</h3>
                        <p>Before sketching out prototypes I wanted to set a clear picture of who the app would be created for.
                        </p>
                        <div>

                                    I created:
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <li>2 personas to represent the majority of users who will be using this application.</li>
                                <li>These personas are based upon the extensive research of competitor apps, and the surveys and interviews conducted previously.</li>
                                <li>The users' goals, motivations, pain points, and common lifestyles were combined to create these profiles and are used to drive the app design and development.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>I used these personas to direct the vision.</p>

                                <p>I created the user journey to to catalogue our user's process. Creating a journey map allowed us to fully understand the interactions and thoughts that users complete while using the app. It provided us a foundation in which we could build an app that would better serve the user and their needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>One of the journey maps that I created was to exemplify the journey our user, Sylvia used for her professional development at work.

                        <h2>Prototype</h2>
                        <h3>Sketches</h3>
                        <p>I began by using paper and pen to draw low-fidelity wireframes to quickly make fundamental design decisions that would help hasten the design process.

                            In creating these initial sketches I consulted with the initial user interviews, competitive analyses, business goals, and heuristic guidelines.
                            
                            Having this previous research helped to effectively design the app in a way that was not only more appealing and usable to the user, but also more cost effective--mitigating the need for more expensive changes later in the development of the app.
                            
                            I used these sketches throughout the rest of the app design to ensure that we were making progress and furthering the design and vision of Discoverly.

                        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                        <p>Using Figma, I translated my first sketches into mid-fidelity wireframes. These gave me a better sense of placement and were much easier to use with user testing.

                            Then, I polished these renditions by adding relevant imagery, and color, beginning to develop the style guide.
                            
                            I tested the prototypes throughout the design process, and this allowed for continual improvements, and avoided any late-stage, drastic changes.

                    <h2>Test</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the process of understanding, observing, ideating, and prototyping I was able to conduct tests on potential users.

                        Developing the app iteratively and throughout allowed me to make changes on Thea pp progressively; meaning smaller, cheaper changers at the beginning, and being able to test more of the components with users, throughout.
                        
                        I was able to ensure that the needs of the company and stakeholders were more easily incorporated with the needs of the users.
                        
                        This resulted in a better end product.
